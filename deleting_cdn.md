# Deleting a CDN
{: #deleting-a-cdn}

To delete a CDN, follow these steps:

1. Click **Delete** from the Overflow ![Overflow menu](images/overflow.png) menu. A window appears, asking to confirm that you want to delete.
2. Click **Delete** to proceed.
3. When the delete process is complete, click **Get status** from the Overflow menu again to remove the row from the CDN list. If the delete process has not completed, this action has no effect.

Selecting **Delete** from the Overflow menu deletes only the CDN; it does not delete your account.<br />
If your CDN is configured with HTTPS with DV SAN certificate, it might take up to five hours to complete the delete process.
