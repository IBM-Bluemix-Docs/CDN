# FAQs

## What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a collection of edge servers that are distributed through various parts of the country or the world. Their web content is served from an edge server, which is located in the geographic area closest to the customer who requests the content. This technique lets the users receive the content with less delay than we could achieve by delivering the content from one centralized location. It delivers a better overall experience for your customers.

## How does a Content Delivery Network (CDN) work?

A CDN achieves its purpose by caching web content on edge servers around the world. When a user requests web content, the content request is routed to the edge server that is geographically closest to that user. By reducing the distance the content must travel, the CDN offers optimized throughput, minimized latency, and increased performance. 

## How is my IBM Cloud Content Delivery Network service account created?

Your account is created during the CDN order process, when you click on **Select** after navigating through the "Vendor selection" menu.

## What do I do when my CDN is in CNAME_CONFIGURATION Status?

For HTTP-based CDN, update your DNS record so that your website points to the `CNAME` associated with your new CDN mapping. For HTTPS-based CDN, this DNS update is **NOT** needed.

**Note**: It may take up to 15-30 minutes for the update to become active. Check with your DNS provider to obtain an accurate time estimate.

## What will I be billed for?

You are only billed for bandwidth used per IBM Cloud Content Delivery Network instance. If no bandwidth is used by your CDN, no charges are incurred. Bandwidth prices vary, depending on the regional location of the edge server. You can see bandwidth pricing by geographic region in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix-Docs/CDN/blob/master/getting-started.md#pricing-shown-in-usd) section for this service.

## When will I be billed?

IBM Cloud Content Delivery Network billing occurs according to the billing period established in your {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} Account.

## How do I view the metrics and usage?

You can view metrics and usage on the **Overview** page, which can be reached by selecting your CDN from the **Content Delivery Networks** page. **NOTE**: After you create your CDN, it may take up to 48 hours for metrics to appear.

## I created a CDN and there was data traffic through the CDN. Why don't my metrics show up?

After a CDN is created, it takes 48 hours for metrics to appear.

## Is there a minimum number of days for which I can view metrics? Is there a maximum?

There are a minimum and a maximum number of days for which you can view metrics using IBM Cloud Content Delivery Network with Akamai. Metrics can be gathered for a minimum of 7 days. Metrics can be viewed for a maximum of 90 days. For those using the API, it is recommended to use 89 days as the maximum, to account for any differences in time zones.

## Why is the hit ratio non-zero when total hits are zero?
Hit ratio represents the percentage of times the content was delivered from the Edge Server Cache, rather than being delivered from the Origin Server. It is calculated as follows:

```
((Edge hits - Ingress hits)/Edge hits) * 100

where: 
Edge hits is defined as "All hits to the edge servers from the end-users"
Ingress hits is defined as "Origin or Ingress hits are for traffic from your origin to Akamai edge servers"
```
 
Because Hit Ratio is calculated at the Account level and not per CDN, the Hit Ratio will be the same for all the CDNs in your account. This fact also explains why the Hit Ratio may be non-zero when the number of Edge hits for a particular CDN is zero.

## If I select `delete` from the CDN's overflow menu, does that delete my account?

No; it will only delete that CDN. Your account still exists, and you can create additional CDNs.

## Does caching use push or pull?

Content Caching is done using an _origin pull_ model. Origin Pull is a method by which data is "pulled" by the edge server from the Origin Server, as opposed to manually uploading the content onto the edge server. 

## Is there a maximum value for Time To Live? A minimum?

The maximum value for Time To Live is 2,147,483,647 seconds, which equates to roughly 68 years! The minimum value is 30 seconds.

## Is there a limit on the number of Origin and TTL entries?

Yes, the combined limit is 75 entries per CDN.

## Is there a limit on the number of CDNs I can have?

Yes, you can have a limit of 10 CDNs per account.

## Is there a recommended browser to use for CDN service configuration?

Yes, Firefox and Chrome are the recommended browsers. It is recommended that you use their latest versions with your IBM Cloud Content Delivery Network.

## What is the purpose of providing a path when creating my CDN?

If you provide a path while creating your CDN, it allows you to isolate the files that can be served through CDN from a particular Origin Server.

## How do I know my CDN is working?
Run the following 'curl' command by replacing "origin.cdntesting.net/assets/ibm_3d.gif" with the respective file path on your origin: 
```
curl -I -H "Pragma: akamai-x-cache-on, akamai-x-cache-remote-on, akamai-x-check-cacheable, akamai-x-get-cache-key, akamai-x-get-extracted-values, akamai-x-get-nonces, akamai-x-get-ssl-client-session-id, akamai-x-get-true-cache-key, akamai-x-serial-no" origin.cdntesting.net/assets/ibm_3d.gif
```
If the output of the command matches the following format, the CDN is working as expected: 
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Server: nginx/1.13.0

...

X-Cache: TCP_HIT from a199-117-103-28.deploy.akamaitechnologies.com (AkamaiGHost/9.0.2.1-20488781) (-)

```

## My CDN is in an Error State. What do I do now?
Please refer to the ['Getting Help and Support'](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/CDN/getting-help.html#gettinghelp) page, or open a ticket in the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/).

## Where do I find my CNAME if I didn't provide one? 
Click on your CDN to access the **Overview** Page in the Portal. On the right corner you can see a **Details** section with the `CName` information.

## Is there a limit on the number of Purge requests that can be active at once?
Yes. There can only be 5 active purge requests at a time.

## My Purge Request for a given file path is in Progress. Can I submit a new request for the same file path?
No. There can only be one active Purge request for a given file path at a time.

## Is Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) supported with the IBM Cloud Content Delivery Network service? How does it work?
IPv6 (or dual stack support) is supported by Akamai's Edge servers. It is designed to help customers with IPv4 only origin to accept connections from IPv6 clients, convert from IPv6 to IPv4 at the Edge and go forward to the origin with IPv4.

**NOTE:** Creating an IBM Cloud CDN using an IPv6 address as the Origin Server Address is not supported.

## What are the rules for the Hostname?
The `Hostname` input string **must**:
  * consist of alphanumeric characters
  * be less than 254 characters
  * end with a valid top-level domain name
  * must **not** end in 'cdnedge.bluemix.net` (that ending is used for CNAMES and is reserved)

Please refer to RFC 1035, section 2.3.4 for more details.

## What are the custom CNAME naming conventions?
The `CNAME` input string must adhere to the following rules:
  * **must** be unique (it cannot be in use by any other IBM Cloud CDN)
  * less than 64 alphanumeric characters
  * special characters `! @ # $ % ^ & *` are **not** allowed
  * underscores `_` are **not** allowed
  * periods `.` are **not** allowed
  * dashes `-` are allowed, but the CNAME cannot begin or end with a dash

## What are the rules for Bucket names?
Bucket names:
  * must be at least 1 character
  * can be no more than 199 characters long
  * can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters are allowed), numbers, and hyphens
  * must **not** be formatted as an IP address (for example, 127.0.0.1)
  * **cannot** start with a period (.)
  * can end with a period (.)
  * Only one period (.) is allowed between labels (for example, my..ibmcloud.bucket is not allowed). 

**NOTE**: Although uppercase letters and periods can pass validation, we suggest that you always use DNS-compliant Bucket names.

## What are the rules for the Path string for the Origin?
The Path is optional when creating your CDN. However, if provided, the Path **must**:
  * be less than 1000 characters in length
  * begin with '/'

## For the **Add Origin** command, are there any rules to follow for the Path string?
For **Add Origin**, the path is mandatory. Also if your CDN was created with a path, the path for **Add Origin** must start with the CDN path as the prefix. For example, if the CDN path was specified as `/storage`, to invoke **Add Origin** with a path called `/examplePath`, the path provided would be `/storage/examplePath`'.

## In what format should I provide the file extensions for creating an Object Storage Origin Type with this CDN service?

File extensions should be comma separated. For example, the list "txt, jpg, xml" is a valid list. Any particular extension cannot be longer than 10 characters.

## Are there any restrictions on what HTTP and HTTPS port numbers are allowed for Akamai?
Yes. For the Akamai vendor, only the following port numbers are allowed: 
72, 80-89, 443, 488, 591, 777, 1080, 1088, 1111, 1443, 2080, 7001, 7070, 7612, 7777, 8000-9001, 9090, 9901-9908, 11080-11110, 12900-12949, 20410, and 45002.

## What URL should be used for access to data under the CDN or Origin Path? 
The path for a CDN mapping or for the origin is treated as a directory. Therefore, users trying to access the origin path should access it as a directory (with a slash). For example, if CDN `www.example.com` is created using the path that includes the `/images` directory, the URL to reach it should be `www.example.com/images/`

Omitting the slash, for example, using `www.example.com/images` will result in a **Page Not Found** error.

## For HTTPS, why can't I connect through a curl command or browser using the Hostname?

Currently HTTPS is supported only through a Wildcard certificate. As a result of this limitation, the connection must be made using CNAME; trying to connect using the Hostname will result in failure.

## What should be the expected behavior when loading the CNAME or hostname on your browser for the supported CDN protocols?

|Browser URL| CDN with HTTP protocol only | CDN with HTTPS protocol only | CDN with both HTTP and HTTPS protocols |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|
|http://hostname| Successful load | 301 Moved permanently | 301 Moved permanently |
|https://hostname | Access denied | Redirects to IBM Cloud Webpage | Redirects to IBM Cloud Webpage | 
|http://cname| 301 Moved permanently | Access denied | Successful load | 
|https://cname| Redirects to IBM Cloud Webpage | Successful load | Successful load |

## How do I set up my Content Delivery Network for IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS)?
[Here's a tutorial](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/tutorials/static-files-cdn.html#accelerate-delivery-of-static-files-using-a-cdn) on creating a Content Delivery Network for IBM Cloud Object Storage.

## Why doesn't my hostname load on the browser when choosing IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) as the origin?

When your IBM Cloud CDN is configured to use IBM COS as the object storage, direct access to the website will not work. You must specify the complete request path in the browser's address bar (for example, `www.example.com/index.html`). This behavior is caused by the index document limitation in IBM COS.

## What is the largest file size that can be delivered via Akamai CDN?

Attempts to retrieve or deliver files larger than 1.8GB will receive a `403 Access Forbidden` response for the default performance configuration. If Large File Optimization is enabled, file downloads up to 320GB are possible.

## I received notification that my Origin Certificate is expiring. What do I do now?

Follow the steps outlined in [this article](https://community.akamai.com/docs/DOC-7708) from Akamai.

## What is a Byte-range request, and how does it work with Akamai CDN?

A Byte-Range request is used to retrieve partial content from an origin server. The Range HTTP request header indicates which part of the content the server should return. Several parts can be requested with one range header at once, and the server may send back these ranges in a multipart response. If the server sends back ranges, it responds with a 206 (Partial Content) status.

When a byte-range request is sent using IBM Cloud CDN with Akamai, the user may receive a 200 (OK) response code for the first request, and a 206 response code for all subsequent requests. This is because Akamai edge servers request content from the origin in compressed format. So, when an edge server doesn't have an object in its cache, nor does it have any information regarding the content length of the object, it will go forward to the origin and will request the entire object. In this case, the origin serves the object without the content length header to Akamai, and the end user would be served the whole object even though it was a byte-range request. Thus the 200 Status code. On subsequent requests, the edge server has the object in its cache and will serve the 206 status code.

One way to ensure a 206 response, even for the first byte-range request, is to disable `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` on your origin server.

## What security is included with IBM CDN solution with Akamai?

By using the distributed Akamai platform, you get unparalleled scale and resiliency with more than 240,000 servers in over 130 countries. The Akamai Platform stands between your infrastructure and your end users, and it acts as first level of defense for sudden surges in traffic. Akamai Intelligent Platform also is a reverse proxy that listens and responds to requests on ports 80 and 443 only, which means that traffic on other ports is dropped at the edge without being forwarded to your infrastructure.
